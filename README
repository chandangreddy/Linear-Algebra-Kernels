Required software:


* PPCG and dependent packages
* Autotuner 
* OpenCL or Cuda SDK

OpenCl Blas kernels
OpneCL_Dir = {Benchmark}/Opencl
* modify the OpenCL_SDK and BLAS_SDK varibles according to your machine installation in {OpenCL_Dir}/common.mk
* to build, execute make blas command in each of the benchmark directories 
* run the resulting executable


CUDA Blas Kernels
CUDA_DIR = {Benchmark}/CUDA
* make sure nvcc compiler is installed
* to build, execute make blas command in each of the benchmark directories
* run the resulting executable

PPCG generated kernels
Polybench_DIR = {Benchmark}/polybench-c-3.2
* Setup PPCG_DIR, OpenCL_DIR, AUTOTUNE_DIR and POLYBENCH variables in {Polybench_DIR}/common.mk
* to build and run, execute make opencl or make cuda in each of the benchmark directories
* run make autotune to launch autotuning. Autotuning parameters can be changed in expolre-params.py in each benchmark directory
* Setup the TARGET variable in {Polybench_DIR}/commom.mk accordingly
* Best configuration found after autotuning will be printed in {benchmark}_autotune.log
* Update these configurations in the Makefile inside individual directory and do make opencl/make cuda, to execute the benchmark with the best configuration
