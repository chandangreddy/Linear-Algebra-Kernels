Required software:
* PPCG and dependent packages
* Autotuner 
* OpenCL or Cuda SDK


OpenCl Blas kernels
OpneCL_Dir = {Benchmark}/Opencl
* modify the OpenCL_SDK and BLAS_SDK varibles according to your machine installation in {OpenCL_Dir}/common.mk
* to build run make blas command in each of the benchmark directory
* run the resulting executable


CUDA Blas Kernels
CUDA_DIR = {Benchmark}/CUDA
* make sure nvcc compiler is installed
* to build run make blas in each of the benchmark directory
* run the resulting executable

PPCG generated kernels
Polybench_DIR = {Benchmark}/polybench-c-3.2
* Setup PPCG_DIR, OpenCL_DIR, AUTOTUNE_DIR and POLYBENCH variables in {Polybench_DIR}/common.mk
* to build and run, execute make opencl or make cuda in each of the benchmark directory
* run make autotune to launch autotuning. Autotuning parameters can be changed in expolre-params.py in each benchmark directory
* Best congfiration found after autotuning will be printed in {benchmark}_autotune.log
* Update these configration in the Makefile inside individal directory and do make opencl/make cuda to collect numbers with the best configration
